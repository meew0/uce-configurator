# [Umineko Catbox English configurator](https://meew0.github.io/uce-configurator)

An in-browser tool that allows you to make certain aesthetic changes to [Umineko Catbox English](https://andolga.github.io/umineko-catbox-english/), the unofficial English patch of the visual novel <a href="https://vndb.org/v24">Umineko</a>, mainly to make it look more like <a href="https://umineko-project.org/en/">Umineko Project</a>.

Currently it supports changing the font and the BGM titles. These features should be usable but there may be bugs. More tweaks to follow.
